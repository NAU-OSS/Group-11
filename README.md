#Question

These two functions take as parameters two sets of mantissa and characteristic and a char array to hold the result of the arithmetic operations. The result of the add or subtract should be converted into char's and placed in the result array. The array must end with a '\0'. The 'len' parameter tells how many characters can be placed on the result array. For these functions to return true you must at a minimum store the characteristic of the result. If the result is a non-integer place as many of the digits as will fit in the result after a decimal point.
